Each bolt does 1d10 points of damage and requires the victim to make a successful Fort save. Failure indicates the target is paralyzed for 1d4 rounds and temporarily loses a single point from one of its ability scores (determined by the judge or at random). Paralysis and ability score loss from multiple failed saves do stack.",

These bolts cause 1d12 damage, and cause each target to temporarily lose 1d2+1 points from a single ability score (determined by the judge or at random). In addition, each target must make a Will save or go insane for 1d4 rounds. The judge should check each round to determine the actions of the afflicted while the insanity lasts. Each round there is a 50% chance they do nothing other than tear at their hair, babble incoherently, and froth at the mouth; a 25% chance they attack a nearby creature at random; and a 25% chance they perform a normal action.",

These bolts cause 1d14 damage and cause each target to temporarily lose 1d3 points from a single ability score (determined by the judge or at random). In addition, each target must make a Fort save or be crippled for 1d4 rounds. During this time, their movement rate is reduced to 5’ and they suffer a -4 penalty to all attacks, damage, saving throws, and spell checks.",

These bolts cause 1d16 damage and cause each target to temporarily lose 1d4 points from a single ability score (determined by the judge or at random). In addition, each target must make a Will save or be cursed (as the cleric spell). Another spell check is made to determine the potency of the curse using all the same modifiers as the cleric’s initial spell check for bolt from the blue, and the final result is compared to the curse spell table (see p. 273).",
          "34-35": "The cleric can unleash a number of bolts equal to twice his CL, which can be aimed at multiple targets within the spell’s range. These bolts cause 1d20 damage and cause each target to temporarily lose 1d5+1 points from a single ability score (determined by the judge or at random). In addition, each target must make a Will save or permanently lose one point from that ability.",

These bolts cause 1d30 damage and cause each target to permanently lose 1d3 points from a single ability score (determined by the judge or at random). In addition, each target is branded with a symbol of the deity’s displeasure. Such marked individuals are treated as enemies of the cleric’s faith and attacked on sight by his followers. In addition, all spell checks against those targets by clerics of the offended deity enjoy a +10 bonus. Only miraculous magics by another powerful cleric or a sincere quest on behalf of the offended deity’s church can remove this mark once it has been bestowed on a subject."
