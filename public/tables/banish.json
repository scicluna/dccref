    "general": "The cleric banishes a creature from his presence and potentially forces it back from whence it came. This spell is usually employed to force a supernatural creature back to its native plane, though it can also be used to send mundane creatures back to their lairs. The cleric specifies a single target. This can be a creature within line of sight or a creature that is not present, provided the cleric possesses a physical memento (lock of hair, fingernail, favored weapon, drop of blood, etc.). The cleric then casts the spell, and the target is affected as described below.",
